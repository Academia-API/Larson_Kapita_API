# Briefly about api

APIs are sometimes seen as contracts, with documentation that constitutes an agreement between the parties: if party 1 sends a request remotely according to a particular structure, party 2's software will have to respond according to the conditions defined.

Because APIs simplify the way developers integrate new application components into an existing architecture, they facilitate collaboration between IT and business teams. Business needs often change rapidly in the face of constantly evolving digital markets, where new competitors can disrupt an entire sector with a new application. To remain competitive, it is important for these businesses to support the rapid development and deployment of innovative services. Cloud-native application development is an obvious way of increasing the speed of development. It is based on connecting a microservices-type application architecture via APIs.

APIs are a simplified way of connecting your own infrastructure through cloud-native application development. They also allow you to share your data with your customers and other external users. Public APIs offer unique business value, as they can simplify and develop your relationships with your partners, and potentially monetise your data (the Google Maps API is one example).
